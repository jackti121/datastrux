## Assignment Criteria

======================================================================================================

Add the following functionality:

    - [ ] UNION
        - return a union of sets A and B. 
        - a union is the set of elements that are in either A or B, or both

    - [ ] INTERSECTION
        - returns an intersection of sets A and B.
        - an intersection is the set of elements that are in both set A and set B

    - [ ] SUBTRACTION
        - returns the difference of set A and B.
        - the subtraction/difference of sets A and B is the set of elements that are in A but not in B

    - [ ] ADD
        - add an element to the set

    - [ ] DELETE
        - remove an element from the set

    - [ ] ELEMENT_OF
        - determine if an item is a member of a set.

    - [ ] IS_SUBSET
        - does set A contain all elements of set B

    - [ ] EMPTY SET
        - is it an empty set

    - [ ] COMPLEMENT
        - returns the compliment of set A vs the universal set of U
            - example: 
            - universal set = {t, e, x, a, s}
            - set A = {e, a}
            - compliment of A = {t, x, s}
