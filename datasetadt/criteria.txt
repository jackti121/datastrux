In class we began to build a SET abstract data type. 
It contained data and the methods needed to manipulate the data.  


Add the following functionality:

    done UNION - return a union of sets A and B. 
        a union is the set of elements that are in either A or B, or both

    INTERSECTION - returns an intersection of sets A and B.
        an intersection is the set of elements that are in both set A and set B

    done SUBTRACTION - returns the difference of set A and B.
        the subtraction/difference of sets A and B is the set of elements that are in A but not in B


    done ADD an element to the set

    done DELETE an element from the set

    done ELEMENT_OF determine if an item is a member of a set.

    done IS_SUBSET

    done EMPTY SET

    done COMPLEMENT - returns the compliment of set A vs the universal set of U
        example: 
        universal set = {t, e, x, a, s}
        set A = {e, a}
        compliment of A = {t, x, s}


Upload your well documented code here. Include  a README and any other supporting documentation.
Not sure what these things are? Do a little research on SET theory.  
Be sure to include what you found in your citations!
