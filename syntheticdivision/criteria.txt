Write a program in any language to evaluate a polynomial using 1) the obvious expansion and  2) the synthetic division expression.  Calculate run times for degree 10 - 20 polynomials.  Collect the data and plot the results.

 

Was there a difference in execution time?

Which method took longer to evaluate?

What is the order (Big-Oh) of each strategy?  Was that born out by  your plot?
